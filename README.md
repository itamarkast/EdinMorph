# UoEmorphology

Materials from Itamar Kastner's University of Edinburgh Morphology course (see my LAGB 2023 presentation, and other information here: [https://itamarkast.github.io/UoEmorphology/](https://itamarkast.github.io/UoEmorphology/).

The semester is underway and this repository is being updated continuously. I recommend importing it into Overleaf.

LaTeX code for the instructor notes is originally by Byron Ahn and Craig Sailor.
