## Class discussion

### Questions for self-reflection (already done in your journals):

- Name something you're good at
- Say what you're at uni for
- Two memories with marks

### Questions for group discussion (in groups of 3-4)

1. What are you taking this course for?
2. What do you want to get out of it?

### Questions for class discussion

- What do we really want to evaluate?
- How would we like that to be assessed?
- What would you like to create?


## Assessment structure (as discussed in class)

What we want to evaluate:

- What we've learned and how we've grown (portfolio: reflections)
- How well we've learned the skills (portfolio: exercises)
- How we can apply the new knowledge (project)

Accordingly, self-assessment will rely on the following:

- Portfolio (Learn Journal) with self-reflection and answers to exercises
- Self-evaluations at midterm and end of semester
- Optional "exit interview" at end of semester
- Group project (any medium, can be creative) - devote time to this in class some Thursdays
- Project topic due around Weeks 5-6
- Project presentation around Weeks 9-11
- Projects due Week 12: Thu 11.04.23
- Portfolios and self-evaluations due Week 14: Tue 22.04.23

Working in pairs or small groups on the exercises is permitted and encouraged! There's no need to disclose anything in the journal, though I imagine that the reflections and self-evaluations will discuss collaboration.

Students give themselves marks at the end of the course, based on their self assessment. The instructors reserves the right to change these; in practice, this means raising marks when students are too hard on themselves.


## Portfolio, self-assessment and feedback

### What's a portfolio for?

Learning is an active process: it happens best when we're all engaged. Learning is also something that we can learn how to do better. Think of a hobby you might have or a skill you've learned: you've probably perfected it for a while, paying close attention to what did or didn't work.

That's why both students and the instructor will reflect on how the course is going and what they've learned. After each class we'll all write short self-reflections. I'll also comment on yours and you'll be able to comment on mine. Together, these will form our portfolios. At the mid-term point and at the end of the semester, we'll take stock of what we've learned, as documented in the portfolio.

Since we're also learning some specific skills in formal linguistics, we will work on exercises as well. You'll write up short answers to these in the same system, and the datasets will be discussed either through the feedback system or in class.

### What do we need to do?

After every class you'll need to write one self-reflection and answer one exercise. Afterwards you need to read my feedback on your entries.

What happens is:

1. We have class.
2. We reflect on what we've learned and what our expectations are for next class.
3. We write down brief (1-paragraph) reflections in one entry, e.g. one titled "Week 1, Tue: Reflection".
4. I comment on these, and you might comment on mine.
5. I will also distribute exercises, usually datasets to be explored. In this case, you will also suggest solutions to these problems, though often there won't be just one solution, e.g. in a short entry titled "Week 1, Tue: Exercise".
6. I give feedback on the exercises either individually in the journal or in collaborative discussion in class.

So: after any given class, you'll write a short self-reflection and an answer to an exercise. Within a reasonable amount of time, I'll react to these journal entries. The collection of all journal entries and my feedback is your Portfolio.

### When should we do everything by?

There is no deadline, though I recommend that you do so as soon as you can. You decide how much effort you put into this course and plan your time accordingly - that's not my business. I will write my reflections on the same day and try to give everyone individual feedback within a week.

You can get Learn notifications for when I give you feedback, but you could also just check your journal before class or at the end of the week.

### What kinds of things should I write in my self-reflection?

Here are some examples of prompts for reflection:

- What did I find surprising in today's class?
- What did I learn?
- What do I expect next time?
- What do I want to improve on?
- How much effort did I put in?
- How do I like this material compared to other sessions?
- How do I like this material compared to other courses?
- What did I find especially useful this time?
- What did I find especially unhelpful this time?
