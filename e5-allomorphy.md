## Exercise 5: Allomorphy prep

1. Give two examples of allomorphy, from any language.

2. We'll now think more generally about what it means to have a restrictive theory. Let's look at one example from phonology and one from syntax.

### Phonology

Many languages have voicing assimilation, whereby [v] gets devoiced to [f] before a voiceless obstruent like [t]. The rule in (1) formalizes this process, but what issues arise with this formalism? Do you know how phonological theory was further developed to address these issues?

(1) /v/ → [f] / ____ [t]

### Syntax

In phrase structure grammar we had rules such as those in (2). What do they do, and what issues arise with them? Do you know how X-bar theory addressed them?

(2) a. S → NP VP

b. NP → D (Adj) NP

c. NP → (Adj) N

d. VP → V NP

e. VP → V NP PP

f. VP → ...

g. PP → P NP
