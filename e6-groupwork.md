## Exercise 6: Group work prep

This exercise prepares us for upcoming group work. Think back to cases in which you worked on a group project. Can you single out:

- One thing that worked well?
- One thing that did not work well?

We'll discuss the group projects next week. Groups will have 4-5 people each and will have freedom to choose the topic and medium of their project, as we'll discuss.
