2. Go to this link: [Insert shareable link based on this template](https://itamarkast.github.io/UoEmorphology/hexagon1.pptx)
3. Pick the next free slide and put a group member's name on top
4. Start making connections between the different terms
5. Highlight the ones you're stuck on, or unsure of, or want to discuss together
6. We'll discuss together for the last 10-15 minutes of class
