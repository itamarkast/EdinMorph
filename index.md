This site contains the pedagogical and administrative parts of Itamar Kastner's University of Edinburgh Morphology course (see my [LAGB 2023 presentation](https://bialik.ppls.ed.ac.uk/pubs/kastner2023lagb-morphology-course.pdf)). The source code for the course materials can be found (and will be updated) on [the main branch](https://github.com/itamarkast/UoEmorphology/).

The site will be updated as the semester progresses.
