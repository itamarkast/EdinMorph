@article{caucheteuxking20,
	Abstract = {Deep learning has recently allowed substantial progress in language tasks such as translation and completion. Do such models process language similarly to humans, and is this similarity driven by systematic structural, functional and learning principles? To address these issues, we tested whether the activations of 7,400 artificial neural networks trained on image, word and sentence processing linearly map onto the hierarchy of human brain responses elicited during a reading task, using source-localized magneto-encephalography (MEG) recordings of one hundred and four subjects. Our results confirm that visual, word and language models sequentially correlate with distinct areas of the left-lateralized cortical hierarchy of reading. However, only specific subsets of these models converge towards brain-like representations during their training. Specifically, when the algorithms are trained on language modeling, their middle layers become increasingly similar to the late responses of the language network in the brain. By contrast, input and output word embedding layers often diverge away from brain activity during training. These differences are primarily rooted in the sustained and bilateral responses of the temporal and frontal cortices. Together, these results suggest that the compositional - but not the lexical - representations of modern language models converge to a brain-like solution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	Abstract = {A range of studies have concluded that neural word prediction models can distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences with high accuracy. However, these studies are based primarily on monolingual evidence from English. To investigate how these models{'} ability to learn syntax varies by language, we introduce CLAMS (Cross-Linguistic Assessment of Models on Syntax), a syntactic evaluation suite for monolingual and multilingual models. CLAMS includes subject-verb agreement challenge sets for English, French, German, Hebrew and Russian, generated from grammars we develop. We use CLAMS to evaluate LSTM language models as well as monolingual and multilingual BERT. Across languages, monolingual LSTMs achieved high accuracy on dependencies without attractors, and generally poor accuracy on agreement across object relative clauses. On other constructions, agreement accuracy was generally higher in languages with richer morphology. Multilingual models generally underperformed monolingual models. Multilingual BERT showed high syntactic accuracy on English, but noticeable deficiencies in other languages.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

@inproceedings{linzen20acl,
	Abstract = {This position paper describes and critiques the Pretraining-Agnostic Identically Distributed (PAID) evaluation paradigm, which has become a central tool for measuring progress in natural language understanding. This paradigm consists of three stages: (1) pre-training of a word prediction model on a corpus of arbitrary size; (2) fine-tuning (transfer learning) on a training set representing a classification task; (3) evaluation on a test set drawn from the same distribution as that training set. This paradigm favors simple, low-bias architectures, which, first, can be scaled to process vast amounts of data, and second, can capture the fine-grained statistical properties of a particular data set, regardless of whether those properties are likely to generalize to examples of the task outside the data set. This contrasts with humans, who learn language from several orders of magnitude less data than the systems favored by this evaluation paradigm, and generalize to new tasks in a consistent way. We advocate for supplementing or replacing PAID with paradigms that reward architectures that generalize as quickly and robustly as humans.},

	Abstract = {Recent trends suggest that neural-network-inspired word embedding models outperform traditional count-based distributional models on word similarity and analogy detection tasks. We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

	Abstract = {Though state-of-the-art sentence representation models can perform tasks requiring significant knowledge of grammar, it is an open question how best to evaluate their grammatical knowledge. We explore five experimental methods inspired by prior work evaluating pretrained sentence representation models. We use a single linguistic phenomenon, negative polarity item (NPI) licensing, as a case study for our experiments. NPIs like any are grammatical only if they appear in a licensing environment like negation (Sue doesn{'}t have any cats vs. *Sue has any cats). This phenomenon is challenging because of the variety of NPI licensing environments that exist. We introduce an artificially generated dataset that manipulates key features of NPI licensing for the experiments. We find that BERT has significant knowledge of these features, but its success varies widely across different experimental methods. We conclude that a variety of methods is necessary to reveal all relevant aspects of a model{'}s grammatical knowledge in a given domain.},

		  downstream tasks. However, for languages with complex and
		  ambiguous word-internal structure, known as morphologically
		  rich languages (MRLs), it has been hypothesized that
		  syntactic context may be crucial for accurate MA{\&}D, and
		  vice versa. In this work we empirically confirm this
		  hypothesis for Modern Hebrew, an MRL with complex
		  morphology and severe word-level ambiguity, in a novel
		  transition-based framework. Specifically, we propose a
		  joint morphosyntactic transition-based framework which
		  formally unifies two distinct transition systems,
		  morphological and syntactic, into a single transition-based
		  system with joint training and joint inference. We
		  empirically show that MA{\&}D results obtained in the joint
		  settings outperform MA{\&}D results obtained by the
		  respective standalone components, and that end-to-end
		  parsing results obtained by our joint system present a new
		  state of the art for Hebrew dependency parsing.},
