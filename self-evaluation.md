## Mid-term self-evaluation from 2022-23

Please answer the following questions and submit them through the journal as usual; the very last question is optional. You can type directly into the journal or upload a file if you prefer. While you can write as much as you'd like, no answer needs to be longer than a short paragraph.
Part 1: Self evaluation

    We've had 9 sessions. Of these, I attended: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    This also means that I was asked to write 8 self-reflections. I submitted: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    We've had 6 exercises so far. I submitted: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    What has changed in my thinking about morphology so far (if anything)?
    How would I describe my participation in class activities? Am I happy with it?
    How have I supported other students in their learning?
    In what ways have I grown intellectually so far (if any)?
    Is there anything I'm particularly proud of?

Part 2: Course evaluation

    Compared to other courses, the workload on this course has been: low / about the same / high
    What are the biggest differences between this course and others? How do I feel about these differences?
    Are my contributions to class discussion valued and acknowledged?
    Are there ways in which I wish this course were more like other ones?
    Are there ways in which I wish other courses were more like this one?
    Is there something we're doing that we should stop doing? Why?
    Is there something that we aren't doing enough of?

Part 3: Group project

    How would I describe my role and participation in the group project so far? Am I happy with it?
    What is the main contribution of our project?

Part 4: Grading (OPTIONAL)

    OPTIONAL: If I had to give myself a grade on this course so far, which of the following would it be and why? 1st (A) / 2:1 (B) / 2:2 (C) / 3rd (D) / Fail



## Final self-evaluation from 2022-23


This is the final self-evaluation questionnaire. Please submit your responses in the usual way, as a portfolio post. You will want to go back and re-read your entire portfolio in preparation.
In addition, you're welcome to schedule an "exit interview" with me here: https://calendly.com/itamark/morpho23
Please submit your self-evaluation at least a day before the exit interview. In the meeting itself, we will use the self-evaluation as a starting point to:

    Decide on your final mark.
    Discuss how the course has gone.

Part 1: Self evaluation

    We've had 19 sessions. Of these, I attended: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    This also means that I was asked to write just undre 20 self-reflections. I submitted: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    We've had 11 exercises. I submitted: virtually all / most / some / hardly any
    Did I submit the mid-semester self-evaluation? If so, what do I think has changed since then? If not, how did I try to catch up?
    What has changed in my thinking about morphology?
    What has changed in my thinking about linguistics?
    How would I describe my participation in class activities? Am I happy with it?
    In what ways have I grown intellectually?
    What skills have I gained, or developed, which will be useful after my degree?
    In what ways has my relationship with my classmates evolved over the semester?
    Is there anything I'm particularly proud of? Why?
    Is there anything I want to work on in the future? How?

Part 2: Course evaluation

    Compared to other courses, the workload on this course was (in what ways?): low / about the same / high
    Compared to other courses, the degree of anxiety or stress - if any - was (in what ways?): low / about the same / high
    We covered the following topics: Words and morphemes; affix ordering; allomorphy; argument structure; lexical semantics; lexical processing. Which one was my favourite? Why?
    Which one was my least fabourite? Why?
    What were the biggest differences between this course and others? How do I feel about these differences?
    Were my contributions to class discussion valued and acknowledged?
    Are there ways in which I wish this course were more like other ones?
    Are there ways in which I wish other courses were more like this one?
    What should this course definitely stop doing next year?
    What should this course do more of next year?
    There is the possibility of arranging a tutorial slot for next year's course. The tutorial would be dedicated to additional exercises. Thinking about my engagement this year, how often would I realistically attend an additional weekly tutorial session?

Part 3: Group project

    How would I describe my role and participation in the group project? Am I happy with it?
    What is the main contribution of our project?
    What did I learn from working on this project (in terms of content, skills, or both)?
    How could the group have worked (even) better together?

Part 4: Grading

    Since the university requires number marks for this course, I should think of what mark to give myself (and come ready to discuss it at the exit interview if we have one) - see a separate post on Learn for advice on marks.

Part 5: Being acknowledged for my contributions
Itamar might be invited to give presentations on this course, or on this way of teaching and learning, in conferences and seminars in the future.

    Am I ok with excerpts from my portfolio being reproduced anonymously? Yes / No
    Am I ok being acknowledged by name as a participant in the course? Yes / No
    Would I like to take an active part in co-preparing these presentations (scheduling permitting)? Yes / No

Part 6: SSLC feedback (optional)
The most effective way to give LEL feedback is through the Staff-Student Liaison Committees (SSLC). The student reps send around surveys asking for feedback at different times of the year, and will likely do so again at the end of the semester (undergraduate; postgraduate; separate arrangements for PhD/DPT students). This is an important opportunity to reflect on the place of any individual course within the degree programme, as well as on the programme as a whole. Staff take this feedback very seriously but don't always get much concrete, actionable input.
With that in mind:

    What feedback will I submit about this course to the yearly reps and the SSLC? (No need to enter this in the self-evaluation!)
    What feedback will I submit about my other courses to the yearly reps and the SSLC? (Definitely no need to enter this in the self-evaluation!)
